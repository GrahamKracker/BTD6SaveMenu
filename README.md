<h1 align="center">Save Menu</h1>

Adds a button to the map select screen to display a save menu, similar to the mods menu in Mod Helper. Modded towers and
modded maps should be compatible.

A green map name means that it should be entirely safe to play on.

A yellow name means that the save has a different minor update than the game.

A red name means that either there are incompatible (modded towers when the mod is not currently loaded), the save
has a different major update than the game, or the save file version is out of date.

Images were made by me using [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) and [pixilart.com](https://pixilart.com/).
